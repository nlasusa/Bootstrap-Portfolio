# Bootstrap-Portfolio
I enjoyed taking my HW from last week and creating it to be more asthetically pleasing.
I was able to do most of it and researched alot of other little boostrap tricks. 
I added a the bonus sticky footer.
When minimizing the screen, almost everything is responsive EXCEPT for the search bar and Contact, Portfolio, Home, LinkedIn in the header.  I figure I need to add a media query for this, but knew it wasn't meant to be used in this project.
